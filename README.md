## 🔧 Smart Contract Integration

### Game Factory Contract
- **Address**: `0x456F88C4A2F6dA77B78FB93AafD57306efaD186f`
- **Network**: Monad Testnet
- **Function**: `createGameWithLevelsAndCost(string gameName, string[][] levels, uint256 costOfPlay)`

### Publishing Flow
1. Game data formatted as `string[][]` arrays
2. Entry fee converted to wei (MONAD * 10^18)
3. Smart contract deployment via MetaMask transaction
4. Game becomes playable on the platform

## 🎮 Game Data Format

Games are stored as JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "0x001": {
    "Levels": {
      "LevelsCount": 4,
      "Levels": [
        [
          "    0       ",
          "   --       ",
          "       $$   ",
          " %    ===   ",
          "            ",
          "   ^^  > = @",
          "============"
        ]
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
